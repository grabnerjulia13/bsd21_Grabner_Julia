---
### What does the program do?
By entering a calculation way (number operator number) the program calculates the desired calculation. One of the four basic calculation types can be entered as an operator (+,-,*,/).
### Installation guide 
Download the Java zip file and extract it. Then simply open it with IntelliJ or another development environment. 
### How is the program used?
At the beginning of the program you are asked to enter a number, an operator and then again a number. (e.g. 7, +, 8) The program then calculates the input of the desired numbers.
### Further information
+ If an incorrect operator is entered, the program prompts for a new entry.
+ Floating point numbers are allowed; comma with ',' and not with '.'.
